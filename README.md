Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python projects

Hello,

I am optimistic like to travel, love food and get rid of stress by reading fantasy books.
I am very interested in automation and IT.
A few months ago, I started to learn VBA and Python, and I liked them very much; I am still new and don't know a lot of things;
However, I am still learning new things as it is simply impossible to know it all.
